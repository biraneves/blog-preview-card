* My process

** Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

** What I learned
For this project, I was able to apply a concept that I rarely used before: relative font sizes. It was fascinating to discover that one can achieve responsiveness without extensive use of media queries. In fact, I used only one:

#+begin_src css
  body {
      font-size: 100%;
  }

  @media (max-width: 375px) {
      body {
          font-size: 80%;
      }
  }
#+end_src

** Continued development
I intend to continue refining the code to accomplish two primary objectives: enhancing semantic clarity ant transforming it into a React page with reusable components.

** Useful resources
- [[https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_size.asp]] - This enhanced my understanding of the concept of relative font sizes and how to effectively apply it.
